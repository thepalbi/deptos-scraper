# sample-mithril-app - a versatile template creating mithril app
[![npm package](https://nodei.co/npm/sample-mithril-app.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/sample-mithril-app/)


## Purpose

I created this project to build a robust and versatile mithril.js template that can be cloned when we start a new mithril.js project. It is set up with webpack and webpack-dev-server to streamline development and build. A modified version of this template is used by [`create-mithril-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-mithril-app).


## Usage

Clone this project [(here)](https://github.com/highmountaintea/sample-mithril-app.git) and use it as a starting point for your new mithril.js app.

## Development

As this template is improved, it will benefit all the future projects based on it.

## Version History (partial)

* `1.0.8` - updated `webpack` for latest security fixes
* `1.0.7` - updated to `mithril 2.0.4`
